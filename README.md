Dynamic and contextual input mappings for Bevy, inspired by [Unreal Engine Enhanced Input](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/enhanced-input-in-unreal-engine).

## Features

* Map inputs from various sources (keyboard, gamepad, etc.) to gameplay actions like `Jump`, `Move`, or `Attack`.
* Assign actions to different contexts like `OnFoot` or `InCar`, controlled by `Actions<C>` components.
* Layer multiple contexts on a single entity, controlled by priority.
* Apply modifiers to inputs, such as dead zones, inversion, scaling, etc., or create custom modifiers by implementing a trait.
* Assign conditions for how and when an action is triggered, like "hold", "tap", "chord", etc. You can also create custom conditions by implementing a trait.
* Control how actions accumulate input from sources and consume it.
* React to actions with observers.
